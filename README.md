# Percolation Simulation
A Java program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation and draw pixel images.

<ul>
<li>Wrote a Java program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation and draw pixel images</li>
<li>Modeled an N-by-N sites percolation system. Created a data type Percolation using the Weighted Quick-Union algorithm with various Java APIs.</li>
<li>Perform a series of computational experiments, calculated mean and standard deviation of percolation threshold.</li>
<li>Took precode text files as inputs to draw pixel images dynamically by utilizing percolation system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Download the zip file. Extract and open all .java files in src directory using an IDE (eclipse, Xcode, etc).<br><br>
Compile and run PercolationStats to calculate mean and standard deviation of percolation threshold.<br><br>
Choose text file from draw directory to be the input file for PercolationVisualizer main method. Compile and run PercolationVisualizer to draw pixel images dynamically.
