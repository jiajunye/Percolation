# Percolation
A Java program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
Wrote a Java program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.<br>
Implemented a Union class by using the Weighted Quick-Union algorithm.<br>
Modeled a percolation system using an N-by-N grid of sites. Created a data type Percolation with various Java APIs.<br>
Perform a series of computational experiments, calculated mean and standard deviation of percolation threshold.<br>
